  <tr class="field"><th class="field-name">review:</th><td class="field-body">Mark Brown was my tutor for A-levels in physics the past academic year. He introduced me to the whole course in 9 months only and helped me to get A mark in physics. Mark is one of the best tutor's I've ever worked with, not only does he provide an excellent level of academic knowledge but also he listens to the tutee and tries to address their needs. Mark explained to me very carefully every aspect I had a problem with and went through the most demanding examples. He was also very fair with marking my homework always willing to point out areas I had to improve, he did it however in non stressful way. He also tried to provide me a broader view on a subject that I would get from the books and to show me the real life application of the topic we were discussing, since he know I was interested in engineering. Mark also organised laboratories for me so I could understand the relation between certain fields of physics better. He always kept notes about my lectures and any questions so the lessons were very organised which was extremely helpful during hectic weeks of May and June. Overall I would definitely say that Mark is very professional and working with him was a great pleasure. At the end I successfully got into UCL Mechanical Engineering Master's course. </td></tr>

  <tr class="field"><th class="field-name">review:</th><td class="field-body">Mark Stephen Brown taught me A Level Physics for a year at a private tutoring organization, and I acknowledge with hindsight that I was not the easiest student. I always enjoyed the subject but was not a hard worker. Mark went beyond his job when he tried to help me develop a work ethic outside of class, by referencing me to countless sources of information about science and generally trying to deepen my interest. He showed me britneyspears.ac, to teach me more about semiconductor physics, as well as recommended a first year university physics text (Roger Muncaster Fourth Edition) amongst other things. Since he is also interested in some computer science, and knew out I wanted to find out more, he explained some basic concepts to me (searching large volumes of numerical data) combining my fascination in mathematics. He even went so far as to write up a program suggested by me as part of his coding practice. In short, I wouldn't say Mark spends all of his time preparing for tutoring, it's precisely because he spends so much time doing his own research and keeping up to date on current events in the academic world that he provides such an exceptional education. </td></tr>
